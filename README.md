# DVT-Elevator
The application should adhere to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to ensure modularity and maintainability. 
The console application must include the following key features:

Real-Time Elevator Status Display the real-time status of each elevator, including its current floor, direction of movement, whether it's in motion or stationary, and the number of passengers it is carrying.

Interactive Elevator Control Allow users to interact with the elevators through the console application. 

Users should be able to call an elevator to a specific floor and indicate the number of passengers wai?ng on each floor.

Multiple Floors and Elevators Support Design the application to accommodate buildings with multiple floors and multiple elevators. 
Ensure that elevators can efficiently move between different floors.

Efficient Elevator Dispatching Implement an algorithm that efficiently directs the nearest available elevator to respond to an elevator request.

Minimize wait ?mes for passengers and op?mize elevator usage.

Passenger Limit Handling Consider the maximum passenger limit for each elevator. 
Prevent the elevator from becoming overloaded and handle scenarios where addi?onal elevators might be required.

Considera?on for Different Elevator Types Although the challenge focuses on passenger elevators, 
consider the existence of other elevator types, such as high-speed elevators, glass elevators, and freight elevators.

Plan the applica?on's architecture to accommodate future extension for these types.

Real-Time Operation Ensure that the console application operates in real-time, 
providing immediate responses to user interactions and accurately reflec?ng elevator movements and status.
